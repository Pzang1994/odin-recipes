        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This flavorful chicken quesadilla is quick, easy, and flavorful</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 Sun-dried Tomato Basil Tortillas (or Wraps if you prefer your Quesadillas on the larger side) by Carb Balance
                <li>1/2 cup of Diced or Pulled Chicken (I use the Frozen Herb-Roasted Diced Chicken by Tyson, personally)</li>
                <li>2-3 tsp of Pace Picante Salsa (Mild, Med, or Hot by preference)</li>
                <li>1/2 cup Shredded Cheese (Mexican or Colby)</li>
                <li>1/2 cup Shredded Bell Peppers and Diced Onions</li>
                <li>1/2 Tbsp Butter</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Saute Chicken</p></li>
                    <p>Heat your pan to Med. Add 1/4 Tbsp of butter - just enough to coat the bottom of the pan, plus a little extra. Add Chicken. Toss until chicken is almost fully cooked and starting to get a nice brown color around the edges.</p>
                <li><p>Add Peppers and Onions</p></li>
                    <p>Add in your peppers and onions to the pan when the chicken is almost cooked. Continue sauteing the combination until the chicken is fully cooked and your peppers and onions are nice and hot.</p>
                <li><p>Add Pace Salsa</p></li>
                    <p>Add in your Salsa and give it a nice toss to evenly coat the chicken and peppers. It's important not to use too much, because you don't want your quesadilla to end up soggy. Cook off the excess salsa/moisture.</p>
                <li><p>Combine Ingredients in Tortilla</p></li>
                    <p>Place your tortilla on a separate plate and carefully coax your chicken and pepper combo into the middle of it, leaving space on all sides. Sprinkle your shredded cheese on - be sure to distribute the cheese evenly and spread it around the sides.</p>
                <li><p>Finish Cooking your Quesadilla</p></li>
                    <p>Add the remaining butter to the pan, getting that nice coating along the bottom again (You may want to clear the excess salsa left over first). Now fold your quesadilla in half and place it in the pan (It should roughly resemble that classic Quesadilla shape now). Gently press down around the top side with a spatula to get a nice seal using the melting cheese. When the bottom is nice and brown, flip Quesadilla and repeat.</p>
                <li><p>Serve and Enjoy!</p></li>
                    <p>Remove from heat and serve with a side of Sour Cream, Pico de Gallo, or Salsa as desired. You may optionally cut the Quesadilla into four slices as well.</p>
                </li>
