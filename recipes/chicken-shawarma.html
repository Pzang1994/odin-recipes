        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Shawarma is a popular dish originating from the Middle East. It’s a popular street food that is 
                traditionally made in the form of spiced meats that are stacked on a vertical rotisserie with 
                thin slices shaved off as it rotates. But don’t worry! We can cook our horizontally in a good 
                old pan or on the BBQ!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Chicken (Boneless, skinless thighs preferred; breast or tenderloin work great also)
                <li>Fresh Lemon Juice</li>
                <li>Cooking Oil (Sesame is my preferred)</li>
                <li>Spices</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cardamom</li>
                        <li:>Cayenne</li:>
                        <li>Coriander</li>
                        <li>Cumin</li>
                        <li>Paprika (as desired - this is where the spiciness comes from)</li>
                        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
        <h2>Ingredients for Sauce (optional)</h2>
            <p>Shawarma is traditionally served with either a tahini sauce (common in Israel) or a Yogurt 
                Sauce.</p>
            <p>For a Lemon Yogurt Sauce, here's what you need: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cumin</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>
                <li>Lemon</li>
                <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
                <li>Yogurt</li>
            </ul> 
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <p>For the best results, it’s best to marinate the chicken overnight. But to be honest, the volume 
                and flavour of the marinade is intense enough that you can get away with a minimum of 3 hours 
                of marinating. Been there, done that plenty of times, and nobody has complained!</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Mix marinade</strong>
                    <p>For convenience, just mix the marinade directly in a ziplock bag. A bag works best 
                        because the chicken remains nicely coated in the marinade. If you prefer to use a 
                        container, either turn the chicken a few times or increase the marinade by 50%.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Add Chicken</strong>
                <p>Add chicken into the marinade. Seal the bag, removing excess air, then massage to coat from 
                    the outside. Leave to marinade for 12 to 24 hours in the fridge. If you’re pressed for time, 
                    even 3 hours will do!</p></li>
                <li><strong>Yogurt Sauce (optional)</strong>
                <p>Make the yogurt sauce simply by mixing the ingredients then set aside for at least 20 minutes to let the 
                    flavours meld. This will keep for 3 days in the fridge.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Cook Chicken</Strong>
                <p>Cook chicken either on the stove or on the BBQ. It will get a great crust on it from the spices, and you
                   will adore the smell. It's intoxicating!</p></li>
                <li><strong>Rest</strong>
                <p>Rest chicken for at least 3 minutes before serving to allow the juices to redistribute throughout the 
                   flesh, else they will just run out everywhere when you slice the meat.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Serve</strong>
                <p>To serve, just pile everything on a platter and let everybody make their own wraps! The chicken, lettuce, 
                   tomato slices, onion, yogurt sauce and warmed flatbreads – homemade or store bought. If the chicken is 
                   on the larger side, I sometimes slice it. But if they are smaller, I tend to just leave them whole.</p></li> 
                </li>
            </ol>
