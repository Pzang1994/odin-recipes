This was my first major project assigned by The Odin Project, and is a reflection of the skills that I have learned up to this point in the week since starting The Odin Project.
In constructing this website, I made use of the terminal (CLI), VSCode, Git, Github, and much of the HTML that I learned in the previous lessons.
Upon reflection, some things I did well, I think, are:
    1. Formatting the Html. I think I did a good job of formatting the Html contained herein such that other developers would be able to read it fairly easily - or I could, if I wanted to go back through it.
    2. Creatively using Html. There are a couple tricks that I used here that I feel went slightly above and beyond what was required according to the assignment - coding in a "Home" button for instance on the different recipe pages. Adding subtext beneath the Quesadilla stock image.
One thing I think I could have done better is adding and committing to git more frequently. I didn't quite think about that in the course of completing this assignment as much as I think I should have, and didn't fully understand how to best use git. Also, jumping back and forth between VSCode and the Terminal to commit to git felt odd to me (Actually, DO I have to jump back and forth to commit to git?)
In any case, I feel like this first project went pretty well, and if nothing else can stand as a testament to what I've learned over the course of the past week.
